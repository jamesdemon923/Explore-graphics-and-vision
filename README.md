|  [Physically Based Rendering Theory](https://www.pbrt.org/)  | *Physically Based Rendering* introduces the concepts and theory of photorealistic rendering hand in hand with the source code for a sophisticated renderer. |
| [GPU Gems 3](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/foreword) |                                                              |
| [Curves and Surfaces for CAGD](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9781558607378/curves-and-surfaces-for-cagd) | The book's unified treatment of all significant methods of curve and surface design is heavily focused on the movement from theory to application. The author provides complete C implementations of many of the theories he discusses, ranging from the traditional to the leading-edge. |
|     [Polygon Mesh Processing](http://www.pmp-book.org/)      | This book discusses the whole geometry processing pipeline based on triangle meshes. The pipeline starts with data input, for example, a model acquired by 3D scanning techniques. This data can then go through processes of error removal, mesh creation, smoothing, conversion, morphing, and more. The authors detail techniques for those processes using triangle meshes. |

| [Nanite](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/nanite-virtualized-geometry-in-unreal-engine/) | Nanite is Unreal Engine 5's virtualized geometry system which uses a new internal mesh format and rendering technology to render pixel scale detail and high object counts. It intelligently does work on only the detail that can be perceived and no more. Nanite's data format is also highly compressed, and supports fine-grained streaming with automatic level of detail. |
|          [NeRF](https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf)          | NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) is a method that achieves state-of-the-art results for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes by optimizing an underlying continuous volumetric scene function using a sparse set of input views. |

|      [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)       | The NVIDIA® CUDA® Toolkit provides a development environment for creating high performance GPU-accelerated applications. With the CUDA Toolkit, you can develop, optimize, and deploy your applications on GPU-accelerated embedded systems, desktop workstations, enterprise data centers, cloud-based platforms and HPC supercomputers. The toolkit includes GPU-accelerated libraries, debugging and optimization tools, a C/C++ compiler, and a runtime library to deploy your application. |

|          [ImGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)           | Dear ImGui is a **bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++**. It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline-enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic, and self-contained (no external dependencies). |

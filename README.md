|     [Polygon Mesh Processing](http://www.pmp-book.org/)      | This book discusses the whole geometry processing pipeline based on triangle meshes. The pipeline starts with data input, for example, a model acquired by 3D scanning techniques. This data can then go through processes of error removal, mesh creation, smoothing, conversion, morphing, and more. The authors detail techniques for those processes using triangle meshes. |
| [An Invitation to 3-D Vision: From Images to Geometric Models](https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~cer/arv/readings/old_mkss.pdf) | This book is intended to give students at the advanced undergraduate or introductory graduate level and researchers in computer vision, robotics, and computer graphics a self-contained introduction to the geometry of 3-D vision: that is, the reconstruction of 3-D models of objects from a collection of 2-D images. The only prerequisite for this book is a course in linear algebra at the undergraduate level. |

| [Nanite](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/nanite-virtualized-geometry-in-unreal-engine/) | Nanite is Unreal Engine 5's virtualized geometry system which uses a new internal mesh format and rendering technology to render pixel scale detail and high object counts. It intelligently does work on only the detail that can be perceived and no more. Nanite's data format is also highly compressed, and supports fine-grained streaming with automatic level of detail. |
|          [NeRF](https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf)          | NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) is a method that achieves state-of-the-art results for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes by optimizing an underlying continuous volumetric scene function using a sparse set of input views. |
|         [Mitsuba](https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/)         | Mitsuba 3 is a research-oriented *retargetable* rendering system, written in portable C++17 on top of the [Dr.Jit Just-In-Time compiler](https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/drjit). It is developed by the [Realistic Graphics Lab](https://rgl.epfl.ch/) at [EPFL](https://epfl.ch/). |
| [SPlisHSPlasH](https://github.com/InteractiveComputerGraphics/SPlisHSPlasH) | SPlisHSPlasH is an open-source library for the physically-based simulation of fluids. The simulation in this library is based on the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method which is a popular meshless Lagrangian approach to simulate complex fluid effects. |
|      [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)       | The NVIDIA® CUDA® Toolkit provides a development environment for creating high performance GPU-accelerated applications. With the CUDA Toolkit, you can develop, optimize, and deploy your applications on GPU-accelerated embedded systems, desktop workstations, enterprise data centers, cloud-based platforms and HPC supercomputers. The toolkit includes GPU-accelerated libraries, debugging and optimization tools, a C/C++ compiler, and a runtime library to deploy your application. |
| [PN triangle](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/SurfLab/papers/00ati.pdf) | The curved point-normal triangle, in short PN triangle, is an interpolation algorithm to retrieve a cubic Bézier triangle from the vertex coordinates of a regular flat triangle and normal vectors |
|          [ImGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)           | Dear ImGui is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++. It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline-enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic, and self-contained (no external dependencies). |
